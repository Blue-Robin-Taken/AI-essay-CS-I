		<h1>AI Semester Essay</h1>
		<h2>By Julian Thomas</h2>
			<p>AI has become very prominent recently. It's also becoming more useful every day with new innovations like automatic subtitling. However,
				artists have complained that AI might take over parts of their job, there are problems with scams becomming more real, and AI might literally take 
				over the world. Although some of that may be true, AI will have an overall positive effect.
			</p>
		<h2>The Benefits of AI</h2>
		<p>
			As of now, AI has many benefits. It can be used in Data science where doctors can analyze "genetic code to detect medical conditions" (Data Science vs. AI &amp; Machine Learning: Mds@rice 2023), use it "as a tool to understand data and inform business decision-making,"
			and new technologies in programming like Github's Copilot have been very useful for programmers (GitHub Inc., The world's most widely adopted AI developer tool.  2024). AI is the new car that was once the horse. Humanity will move a lot faster than before. 
			Programmers will be able to debug things quicker. Doctors will be able to see what cancers patients might have. Weather could be more predictable. The opportunites are endless.
			AI will definitely improve quality of life for humans in the 21st century and onward.
			
		</p>
		<h2>The Risks of AI</h2>
		<h3>Taking over the world?</h3>
		<p>
			
			Some people fear the risk of AI taking over the whole world and become sentient. AI is also learning more to the point where it's learning things
			that it hasn't been taught (“AI Is Now Learning to Do Things It Hasn't Been Taught”). The only reason this would be a problem is if it was trained
			incorrectly and started to do harm to humans. This is very rare and unlikely to happen, however it's still a possibility if AI starts getting access
			to more things like cars, planes, and maybe military drones. 

			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Art</h3>
			<p>
			Another problem with AI is AI generated Art and scams. If you've ever been on discord for a while, you'll notice that you'll get random DMs from people
			"comissioning" their artwork. It's mostly a bunch of furry art and weird 3d art and trying to grab a quick buck. Although these scams are very easy to spot, 
			it's <i>likely</i> some people fall for them (which is why scammers keep doing what they're doing). 
		</p>
		<h3>The fall of Stack Overflow</h3>
		<p>Of course Stack Overflow is <i>not</i> leaving anytime soon. However, sites like StackOverflow have been losing trafic steadily since 2022 (Stack overflow is CHATGPT casualty: Traffic down 14% in March).
		This is most likely from AI because of the time period. AI at the moment produces code that's very sub par and not accurate for most scenarios. But this will change soon.
	Bugs will soon be a thing of the past. AI will start writing its own code. It might even write more AIs.</p>
		<h2>My Predictions</h2>
		<p>I predict that AI will create a better future for humanity as a whole. At some point, AI might be able to create new products that humans haven't made before
			by creating a neural network similar to that of human creativity. Although that future is very very far into the future, we can be hopeful that one day
			we won't need to work as hard to solve humanity's problems.
