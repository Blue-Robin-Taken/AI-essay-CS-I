		<h1>AI Semester Essay</h1>
		<h2>By Julian Thomas</h2>
			<p>AI has become very prominent recently. It's also becoming more useful every day with new innovations like automatic subtitling. However,
				artists have complained that AI might take over parts of their job, there are problems with scams becomming more real, and AI might literally take 
				over the world. Although some of that may be true, AI will have an overall positive effect.
			</p>
		<h2>The Benefits of AI</h2>
		<p>
			As of now, AI has many benefits. It can be used in Data science where doctors can analyze "genetic code to detect medical conditions" (Data Science vs. AI &amp; Machine Learning: Mds@rice 2023), use it "as a tool to understand data and inform business decision-making,"
			and new technologies in programming like Github's Copilot (GitHub Inc., The world's most widely adopted AI developer tool.  2024). AI is the new car that was once the horse. Humanity will move a lot faster than before. 
			Programmers will be able to debug things quicker. Doctors will be able to see what cancers patients might have. Weather could be more predictable. The opportunites are endless.
			Sites like StackOverflow have been losing trafic steadily since 2022 (Stack overflow is CHATGPT casualty: Traffic down 14% in March).
		</p>
		<h2>The Risks of AI</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h2>My Predictions</h2>
		<p>I predict that AI will create a better future for humanity as a whole. At some point, AI might be able to create new products that humans haven't made before
			by creating a neural network similar to that of human creativity. Although that future is very very far into the future, we can be hopeful that one day
			we won't need to work as hard to solve humanity's problems.
